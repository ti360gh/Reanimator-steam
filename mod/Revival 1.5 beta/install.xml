		<description>Welcome to the amazing 1.5b beta release of Revival.

This patch is far from complete, but is a milestone release in the Revival 1.5 beta branch. A new massive amount of content has been added, including Mythic and Doubled Edged item qualites, over 15 items from the Stonehenge and Abysss expansions and a wealth of cube recipes that can be used in conjuction with 'gambling' tokens, purchased from the gambling vendor in Holborn Station.

As always with the beta releases, don't get too attached to your characters because things will change between updates that might make your characters incompatible. New changes from the 1.5a release are marked with a + and removed changes are marked with a -. Chances are I have forgotten a few changes, these will be noted on the forum as they are recalled.

As always, thank you for your support and patience. This has taken us a really long time, and there is still so much to do. But for now, please enjoy!
